                <h3>Next match: Arsenal vs Manchester City</h3>
                <p class="preview">Just five points separate the sides following the weekend’s results, as we aim to end a 10-league game losing run against Pep Guardiola’s team and defend our unbeaten home record this term while remaining top of the table in the process.
                City may have won on each of their last six trips to Emirates Stadium, but this season they head to N5 having lost their last three away games, and <strong>no team in history has ever won seven-straight league games on our own turf.</strong><br><br><strong>Arteta:</strong> "We’ll play with 15
                players tomorrow! [Our supporters] are so into it with every single ball and giving us energy and support, and basically everything they have been doing. Let’s enjoy it, a beautiful night on a really special day.<br><br><strong>Guardiola:</strong> “Of course it’s important because 
                we can take the points, and the best team so far can’t. But after we have to go to Nottingham Forest and the Champions League and we have the next six fixtures away.</p>

           <p><strong>The Gunners thrashed Everton 4-0 in a midweek match on Wednesday,</strong> restoring their five-point lead over second-place Manchester City and extending their league winning streak to three games. After a brief spell of poor results, it appears as though Arsenal are back on the form that has made them legitimate title contenders for the first time in years.<br><br>
           As bright as things are looking for the hosts, the same cannot be said for the visitors. Bournemouth are just one spot above the basement with 21 points after 24 matches, with their most recent action a 4-1 loss to City. The Cherries are up against recent form and established history this weekend, as they've never won away at Arsenal in six tries, losing by an aggregate score of 17-2.</p>
