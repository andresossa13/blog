            <p>Get the latest and breaking news and updates from the reliable voices who are most passionate about Arsenal Football Club, here at The Arsenal Way.
              Founded in 1886, Arsenal are one of most successful and well-supported football clubs in the world. Arsenal have been a top-flight football club for over 90 years, the longest streak in English football history.
              Arsenal also have the record for the longest unbeaten run in England's top-flight, and their 2003-04 title-winning team under Arsene Wenger were nicknamed The Invincibles.</p>

            <h2>Last Years</h2>
            <p>Arsenal being 1st on the table with the youngest starting 11 in the league is no coincidence. 
               This has been brewing since the day Arteta walked in as the head coach. Its now time to reap the rewards.
               A new Superteam has been born.. There is a new energy around the Emirates stadium. The fans haven’t been on
               the same page like this since the days of Highbury. The players are ready to die for the club and the spirit
               of the “Arsenal Family” has never been more clear to me before. This is Arsenal football club and we are
              coming for Everything</p>
